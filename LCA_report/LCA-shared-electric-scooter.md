## Subject Introduction
Life cycle assessment on the daily use aspect of a general electric scooter used in sharing services was done with the help of the literature and different material libraries available in the tools SimaPro and Edupack Granta. A comparative analysis between electric scooters and the ordinary transport means of which e-scooters are direct rivals was also done.

## Project Description
This project was carried out to determine the environmental impacts through cradle-to-grave life cycle study of shared e-scooters where it includes the five life phases extraction and processing of the raw materials (cradle), manufacturing, distribution, use, and final disposal (grave).

## Inventory Analysis
This LCA study followed the path to meet the defined goal and scope of the study. Used different impact assessment methods and impact categories to know the different environmental impacts of a shared e-scooter. Results were analyzed and a proper life cycle interpretation was made.

## Comparative Analysis
A comparison was made where the emissions from the electric scooter were compared. And a comparative analysis of the urban transport behavior that is affected by the shared electric scooters, was done.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
According to the results, a conclusion was made and it also includes the life cycle phases of an electric scooter that affect the environment in a more negative way. A recommendation was written to an imaginary client where it was also referring how selected technology performed compared to the alternatives.
