# Life Cycle Assessment of Shared Electric Scooters
This repository contains a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of shared electric scooters, examining their environmental impacts through a cradle-to-grave analysis.

## üìã Project Overview
This project was conducted as part of the "Adapting Technology to the Circular Economy" course in the Master in Green Energy Technology program at √òstfold University College. The study investigated the environmental footprint of shared electric scooters through detailed life cycle assessment by analyzing:

- Raw material extraction and processing
- Manufacturing of components (battery, frame, motor, electronics)
- Transportation and distribution impacts
- Use phase emissions
- End-of-life considerations

The assessment was carried out using SimaPro 9 with the ecoinvent 3.7.1 Cut-off library for material and process data.

## üîç Key Research Questions

- Are shared e-scooters an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional transportation methods?
- What are the environmental impacts across the entire lifecycle of shared e-scooters?
- How do shared e-scooters compare to other urban mobility options in terms of emissions?
- Which lifecycle phases contribute most significantly to the overall environmental impact?
- How can the environmental footprint of shared e-scooter services be reduced?

## üìä Methodology

### Functional Unit and Scope
The functional unit defined in the study was one passenger over one kilometer traveled by an electric scooter, with emissions and energy consumption presented as gCO2-eq/km and MJ/km respectively.

The system boundaries include impacts from:

- Production of primary and secondary materials
- Component manufacturing (battery, motor, glider, wheels, etc.)
- Transportation from manufacturing location to use location
- Use phase energy consumption
- End-of-life treatment

### Life Cycle Inventory
The assessment followed ISO 14044 requirements, using:

- Manufacturing data from ecoinvent 3.7.1 Cut-off library
- Transportation data based on estimated routes (China to Europe)
- Average lifetime of two years (7,500 km total distance)
- Average daily travel distance of 10.2 km

### Impact Assessment Methods
Four primary impact assessment methods were employed:

- IPCC 2013 GWP 100a: Climate change impact as CO‚ÇÇ equivalents
- ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (E): Multiple impact categories including land use, toxicity, acidification
- Cumulative Energy Demand: Energy resource consumption across different energy types
- Ecological Scarcity 2013: Environmental impacts weighted using eco-factors

## üî¨ Key Findings

1. **Total Emissions:** The analysis found that a shared electric scooter produces approximately 29.5 g CO‚ÇÇ-eq/passenger-km, which is:
    - 88% less emissions compared to passenger cars (257 g CO‚ÇÇ-eq/passenger-km)
    - 42% less emissions compared to buses (51 g CO‚ÇÇ-eq/passenger-km)

2. **Manufacturing Dominance:** The manufacturing phase accounts for 87.8% of total lifecycle emissions:
    - NiMH battery production contributes 54.7 kg CO‚ÇÇ-eq (30.2% of manufacturing emissions)
    - Electronic controller contributes 44.6 kg CO‚ÇÇ-eq (24.6%)
    - Wheels and electric motor contribute 15.0 and 6.6 kg CO‚ÇÇ-eq respectively

3. **Transport Impact:** Transportation contributes 11.15% of total emissions:
    - Air freight, while only 7.8% of the transport distance, is responsible for 74% of transport emissions
    - Train freight accounts for 25.2% of transport emissions

4. **Lifespan Sensitivity:** Scooter lifespan significantly affects environmental performance:
    - Reducing lifespan from 24 to 18 months increases emissions by 25% (to 39.27 g CO‚ÇÇ-eq/passenger-km)
    - Longer lifespans and more durable construction are critical for sustainability

5. **Urban Transport Behavior:** Shared e-scooters are replacing several transport modes:
    - 42.1% replacing walking trips over 500m
    - 28.4% replacing car trips
    - 27.8% replacing bus trips

## üìù Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested to help reduce the environmental impact of shared e-scooter services:

### Optimizing Operational Scenarios

1. **Reducing collection and distribution distances** for charging
2. **Using more efficient vehicles** for collection activities (can reduce emissions by 12.37%)
3. **Implementing selective collection strategies** - only collecting scooters with low battery (can reduce emissions by 18.8%)
4. **Reducing driving distance per scooter** (potential 27.22% emissions reduction)

### Alternative Transport Routes
An alternative transport route that reduces transport emissions by 71.7%:
- Maintain rail freight from China to Hamburg
- Use ocean freight from Hamburg to Larvik
- Use truck transport for the final leg to Oslo

### Manufacturing Improvements
- Pursue more robust builds with longer service lives
- Develop better battery recycling and end-of-life management

## üìà Future Work

- Include charging infrastructure in the assessment
- Expand analysis of routine maintenance impacts
- Conduct more detailed end-of-life scenarios for batteries
- Investigate potential for renewable energy charging
- Analyze policy interventions to improve shared mobility sustainability
